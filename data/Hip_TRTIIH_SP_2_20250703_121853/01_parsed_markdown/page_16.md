### Insert implantation

The Trident Polyethylene Insert is designed to lock into the shell by means of a circumferential ring that engages the mating groove within the shell. Rotational stability can be achieved when the anti-rotational barbs of the shell interlock with the insert scallops. Trident Alumina Ceramic Inserts are designed to gain fixation within the shell by means of mating tapers. Rotational stability between the components is achieved when the shell's anti-rotational barbs interlock with the insert scallops.

> **Note**
> 
> Having a clear view of the rim of the acetabulum will allow easier visualization of the shell slots and indexing barbs for proper positioning and seating of the liner.

> **Note**
> 
> Use caution handling ceramic components during assembly because of brittle nature of the ceramic material. All components are pre-sterilized and cannot be sterilized after opening.

1. Ensure that the inside of the shell and periphery are clean and free of soft tissue or any other debris which can cause eccentric positioning of the insert and improper seating in the shell.

2. Gently introduce the ceramic or polyethylene insert, making sure that the insert flange scallops are aligned with the slots at the rim of the shell. This orientation will allow the insert to rest on the four indexing barbs and will ensure that the insert is parallel with the shell. Once the insert is seated at the initial position, slowly turn and drop the insert into the final pre-locked position.

3. Select the appropriately sized Plastic Insert Impactor Tip and load onto Insert Positioner/Impactor Handle (Figure 18).

4. Position Insert Positioner/Impactor Handle into the inner diameter of the insert. Take care to align the handle with the axis of the shell. Strike the handle with approximately four firm mallet blows to fully seat the insert (Figure 19).

Figure 18. Image shows a long surgical instrument with a handle on one end and a rounded tip on the other. Purple arrows indicate a specific part of the instrument.

Figure 19. Image shows a cross-section of a hip joint implant. A surgical instrument is shown inserting a component into the acetabular shell. A purple arrow indicates the direction of insertion.
