### Head disassembly

The Head Disassembly Instrument is used to remove an impacted head (Figures 25 and 26). Inspect the stem neck trunnion to verify that no damage has occurred prior to impacting a replacement head. A replacement head may then be attached to the stem neck taper and secured using the Stem Head Impactor.
