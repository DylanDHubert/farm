## Indications, contraindications and precautions

### Indications for U.S. and rest of world:

- Painful, disabling joint disease of the hip resulting from: degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis or late-stage avascular necrosis.
- Revision of previous unsuccessful femoral head replacement, cup arthroplasty or other procedure.
- Clinical management problems where arthrodesis or alternative reconstructive techniques are less likely to achieve satisfactory results.
- Where bone stock is of poor quality or is inadequate for other reconstructive techniques as indicated by deficiencies of the acetabulum.

#### When used with MDM Liners
- Treatment of nonunion, femoral neck and trochanteric fractures of the proximal femur with head involvement that are unmanageable using other techniques.
- Dislocation risks

#### When used with Constrained Liners
- The TRIDENT Constrained Acetabular Insert is indicated for use in primary and revision patients at high risk of hip dislocation due to a history of prior dislocation, bone loss, joint or soft tissue laxity, neuromuscular disease or intraoperative instability.

The TRIDENT II Acetabular Shells are indicated for cementless use only.
