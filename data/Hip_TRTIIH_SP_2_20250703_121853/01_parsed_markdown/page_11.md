## Trident II Clusterhole HA surgical protocol

### Step 5

#### Shell implantation

Assess the acetabular bone and surrounding soft tissue to ensure shell insertion will not be inhibited. Prior to implantation, it is prudent to reassess patient positioning in the surgical field and adjust to the correct position if necessary.

Select the appropriately sized Trident II Clusterhole HA Shell as identified on the product label. Attach the shell to the impactor using the instructions in the table.

An Alignment Guide can be attached to the Shell Impactor to aid in establishing abduction/inclination and anteversion angles (Figure 9). Many surgeons prefer to target a zone of 40±10˚ of abduction and 15±10˚ of anteversion depending on patient anatomy and biomechanics. The shell abduction angle of approximately 45° can be determined by positioning the Alignment Guide perpendicular to the long axis of the patient (Figure 10). Shell anteversion can be set at approximately 20° by moving the Shell Impactor so that the left/right anteversion rod is parallel to the long axis of the patient (Figure 11).

The screw hole pattern in the shell is intended to be oriented superiorly for ancillary screw fixation. During shell insertion, avoid damage to the roughened surface from instruments such as retractors, and avoid dragging across soft tissue to keep the shell free of debris.

Impact the shell into the acetabulum using a mallet until a stable press-fit is achieved. Remove the impactor by carefully unthreading from the shell. The shell seating depth may be determined by viewing the acetabulum through the exposed dome hole. Should further seating be required, the impactor can be reattached to the shell to facilitate secondary impaction.

An optional Hex Dome Hole Plug may only be inserted into the shell using the Trident II Straight Driver (7005-0099) or optional U-Joint Driver (7005-0100). Only these two drivers have a captive tip design to hold the Dome Hole Plug on, however excessive shaking or motion may cause the plug to detach. Evaluate the plug after insertion to confirm it is fully threaded into the shell to prevent impingement with the liner.

#### Instrument instructions

##### Shell impactors
Insert the impactor tip flush with the square recess in the shell dome (Figure 7). Turn the knob clockwise while applying a slight pressure towards the shell until it is attached. For the Straight Shell Impactor, it may be required to apply light pressure on the knob in the direction of the shell to initially engage the threads.

Figure 7.

Failure to completely thread the components together may result in damage to the threads upon impaction. Do not overtighten. The gap on the knob is designed to indicate an inadequate connection and will be concealed after appropriate tightening (Figure 8).

##### Alignment Guides

Lateral 1440-1370
or
Supine 1440-1380

To attach, slide the Alignment Guide onto the flats of the impactor spindle and rotate it to the desired location.
