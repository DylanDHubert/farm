### Head disassembly (continued)

The following table provides a guide for selecting a replacement head. The first two columns describe the stem taper type and original femoral head material used, and the third column lists the available replacement options.

### Notes:
• Metal heads and BIOLOX delta Ceramic Heads with sleeve only can be used in revision cases only if the stem trunnion appears undamaged and intact upon close inspection. The entire hip stem must be revised if this is not the case.

• BIOLOX delta Ceramic Heads and metal heads can be used with polyethylene liners.

• Do not reassemble a BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head and stem. Once a BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head has been assembled to a stem taper, it should never be reassembled to that stem or subsequently assembled to any other stem. In addition, a BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head should only be assembled to an unused stem taper. Once a stem taper has been assembled to any femoral head, it should never be subsequently assembled to any BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head component due to deformation of the stem's taper locking mechanism during initial stem/head assembly.
