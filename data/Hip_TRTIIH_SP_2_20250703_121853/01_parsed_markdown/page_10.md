### Window Trial evaluation

Select a Window Trial of equal diameter or 1mm smaller than the last acetabular reamer used. Attach the Window Trial onto the Shell Impactor to evaluate the fit within the reamed acetabulum (Figure 6). The trial is windowed for visualization and assessment of depth, position, bone contact and congruency within the acetabulum. Impact gently into the acetabulum to avoid damage to the surrounding bone or press-fit.

Figure 6.

### Instructions

#### Window Trial
To attach, insert the tip of the impactor flush with the square recess in the dome of the trial. Turn the knob clock-wise until the trial is attached. For the straight impactor, it may be required to apply light pressure on the knob in the direction of the trial to initially engage the threads.

Failure to completely thread the components together may result in damage to the threads upon impaction and lead to difficulty in detaching the components. Do not overtighten.

> **Note**
> 
> It is recommended to use a Window Trial that is line-to-line or 1mm smaller than the last reamer.
