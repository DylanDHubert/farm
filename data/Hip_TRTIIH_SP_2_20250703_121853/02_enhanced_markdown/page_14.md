## Instructions for Screw Instruments

### Ball Joint Drill Shaft
To attach, retract the sleeve and insert the bit so that the laser marking on the bit is concealed within the shaft tip.

### Ratchet Handle
To attach the driver, retract the sleeve and insert the driver so that the engraved line on the shaft is concealed within the sleeve.

### Drill Bit Length
The Drill Guide conceals 10mm of the Drill Bit length (Figure 16 - example of 40mm Drill Bit).

### Depth Gauge
Locate the end of the bone hole using the hook on the tip of the gauge. Clamp onto the gauge at the level of the screw hole and extract the gauge to use the markings to aid in appropriate screw size selection.
