# Trident II Clusterhole HA Surgical Protocol

## Step 1

### Preoperative Planning and X-Ray Evaluation

Preoperative planning is an essential part of the procedure, and templating should be performed prior to every case. The preoperative planning process should take qualitative and quantitative factors (including patient bone quality, density and morphology) into consideration in order to evaluate and select the appropriate instrument/implant system for the patient. X-ray evaluation may also help detect anatomic anomalies that could prevent the intraoperative achievement of the established preoperative goals. Selecting potential implant style and sizes can facilitate operating room preparation and assure availability of an appropriate selection. When it is done using X-rays that have been suitably scaled for magnification, templating allows the surgeon to predict the style, size and position of the implant that may help restore the correct anatomy of the individual patient.

Template planning can be done using acetate templates for printed X-rays or preoperative planning software for digital studies.

Use the template overlay LTEM116 available through your Stryker representative.

## Step 2

### Acetabular Preparation

The acetabulum is prepared using the surgeon's preferred technique to gain adequate exposure for reaming. Excision of the labrum and osteophytes allows for proper visualization of the bony anatomy and improves ease of reaming.

Stryker's femoral and wing retractors can be utilized to help gain acetabular exposure. (Figure 1)

With the acetabulum exposed, bony defects can be identified. If necessary, bone grafting options may be considered prior to reaming.

### Note

Careful identification and removal of osteophytes can help reduce the possibility of bone-to-bone or component-to-bone impingement.
