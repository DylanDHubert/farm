## Step 7

### Disassembly of Impacted Head

The Head Disassembly Instrument is utilized to extract an impacted head (Refer to Figures 25 and 26). Prior to attaching a replacement head, inspect the stem neck trunnion to ensure no damage has occurred. The replacement head can then be affixed to the stem neck taper and secured using the Stem Head Impactor.

### Revision Procedure for BIOLOX Delta Ceramic Heads Assembled with an Adapter Sleeve

In case the BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head requires revision for any reason, use the Head Disassembly Instrument (Catalog No. 1118-6000* or 6059-9-505, depending on the size of the femoral head) to remove the Ceramic Head. Following this, remove the adapter sleeve using the Ceramic Head Sleeve Disassembly Adapter (Catalog No. 1118-1005* and 1118-6000*).

### Important Note

* The Head Disassembly Instrument (Catalog No. 1118-6000*) is not compatible with heads of sizes 36mm, 40mm, and 44mm.
