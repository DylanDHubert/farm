## Step 6

### Trial Insert Reduction

A joint mechanics evaluation may be performed with implant trials following femoral preparation and shell implantation. Insert a Trial Insert into the Trident II Shell (Figure 17a).

An optional Trial Insert Hex Containment Screw for securing the trial to the shell is available (Figure 17b). Only use a Straight Driver (7005-0099) or optional Trident II U-Joint (7005-0100) to insert the Hex Containment. Only these two drivers have a captive tip design to hold the Hex Containment Screw on, however excessive shaking or motion may cause the screw to detach.

Do not overtighten as this may lead to liner trial damage.

To facilitate insertion/removal of the Trial Insert, Screw Forceps may be placed into the two holes in the plastic face.

After reducing the femoral and acetabular trials, the patient should be taken through a complete range of motion. Trials matching the final selected implant sizes should be used. Careful assessment of impingement at the extreme range of motion should be performed. A final check of hip mechanics should be completed to include range of motion consistent with the patient's normal daily activities.

At this point, joint laxity should also be assessed, taking into consideration the type of anesthetic used and its effects on soft tissue. Additionally, an intraoperative X-ray may be taken at this point to assess leg length, offset, component size and position.

### Note
Impingement should be carefully assessed and avoided during range of motion. Impingement can result in increased wear in metal-polyethylene systems, as well as instability.
