Toolshed - Collection of RAG Tools

The toolshed contains all the specialized tools for the PB&J RAG system:
- Pitchfork: Table data access and manipulation

Each tool is designed to handle specific types of data access patterns,
enabling the Barn to intelligently orchestrate them based on user queries.
